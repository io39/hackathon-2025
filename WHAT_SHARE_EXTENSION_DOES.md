## ✅ What Share Extension Enables

### Scenario: You're on Instagram

**Without Share Extension:**
```
Instagram Post
   ↓
You want to analyze it
   ↓
❌ Can't do anything - stuck in Instagram
```

**With Share Extension:**
```
Instagram Post
   ↓
Tap Share button 📤
   ↓
iOS Share Sheet appears
   ↓
See "Video Analyzer" in list ✨
   ↓
Tap "Video Analyzer"
   ↓
Bottom sheet slides up ⬆️
   ↓
Choose: Hoax Check / Explain / Expand
   ↓
See analysis result
   ↓
Tap "Done" → Back to Instagram
```

## 📱 What You Can Do With It

### ✅ You CAN:
1. **Share from Instagram** → Your app appears in share sheet
2. **Share from TikTok** → Your app appears in share sheet
3. **Share from YouTube** → Your app appears in share sheet
4. **Share from Safari** → Your app appears in share sheet
5. **Share from ANY app** → If it has share functionality
6. **Get bottom sheet overlay** → Beautiful UI slides up
7. **Analyze without leaving** → Stay in Instagram, analyze, return
8. **Quick workflow** → Share → Analyze → Done (30 seconds)

### ❌ You CANNOT:
1. **Auto-detect videos** → Must manually share
2. **Show overlay on top** → iOS doesn't allow this (security)
3. **Run in background** → Extension only runs when shared to
4. **Access Instagram directly** → Can only receive what user shares
